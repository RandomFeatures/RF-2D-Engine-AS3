A 2D Isometric game engine written in Action Script 3

## Isometric Tile Map
There is some interesting math and concepts involved in building an isometric world. When trying to understand it is sometime helpful to see a real world example. 

## A-Star Path Finding
Nothing special here if you have seen one A-Star algorithm you have seen most of them.

## Character/Monster AI
Basic AIs like Attack, Defend, Meander, etc...

## Sprite Animations
There is also a good example of code for playing sprite animations. This is where your artwork is broken into frames and you need to render them in a certain order to create animation. You can then play the animation forward, backward, in a loop, or ping pong it back and forth. This example also shows you how to play that animation at a given speed regardless of frame rate. 

## World Event System
Tiles, Items, Characters, Monsters all have events attached to them that are fired when the play interact with them by clicking. For example you can open an inventory screen when the play clicks on a chest or a dialog box when the player clicks on an NPC

## FSM
Yet another example of a finite state machine. I use them a lot in game development.
